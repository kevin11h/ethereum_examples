# A sample token and token trader contract

* `test/truffle-keys.js` - a set of key pairs that we use in our test cases. To generate these
key pairs, you can use `truffle develop` or the output from `ganachi-cli`, or the tool that I
created https://github.com/matr1xc0in/ethereum_examples/tree/master/eth_key_generator simply for convinience.
